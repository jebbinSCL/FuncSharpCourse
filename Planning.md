# Planning

## Todo
- Better course title

## General notes

Multiple sessions per topic. Don't try and squeeze things unless we don't want to cover them

E.g. 2 sessions
  S1 : Lecture + Reading
  S2 : Exercise, discussion and setting next exercise

In the first s1 session of the course, give a basic exercise that takes less than a week, then start the proper exercise cycle at the first s2 session

How comprehensive can this be?

## High level Areas
- Functional Programming (General concepts)
  - E.g. Pure functions, immutable data, etc
- F# Features and syntax
  - E.g. operators, type providers   
- Pragmatic / Practical concepts
  -  E.g. Database access, web servers, WPF application, game

How to order areas?
I think it would be best to focus on Functional programming and thinking functionally before getting into the hybrid features.
Focus on Func and Functional F# Features
Then General F# features and
Practical concepts

## Definite topics
- Topic 1 : Start the Func : Course / Functional Programming / F# Introduction
  - My Notes:
    - Functional languages becoming more popular + people bring functional capabilities to non functional languages
    - Review last few minutes of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs for quotes?
    - Relavant quotes : 1.
  - Talk Outline:
    - Introduction
      - My Introduction
      - Functional Programming Introduction
        - What is it

          - Linguistic Relativity (See Edinburgh Inf 1 Lec 1)
        - Why is it cropping up more
        - Features that you are already using that came from functional languages
        - Features that you are already using that are functional
