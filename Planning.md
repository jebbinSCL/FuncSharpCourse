# Planning
Multiple sessions per topic. Don't try and squeeze things unless we don't want to cover them

E.g. 2 sessions
  S1 : Lecture + Reading
  S2 : Exercise, discussion and setting next exercise

In the first s1 session of the course, give a basic exercise that takes less than a week, then start the proper exercise cycle at the first s2 session

# High level Areas
- F# Features and syntax
  - E.g. operators, type providers
- Functional Programming (General concepts)
  - E.g. Pure functions, immutable data, etc    
- Pragmatic / Practical concepts
  -  E.g. Database access, web servers, WPF application, game

How should things be ordered? Should I cycle between sections or do all of each section at once? Mixing things up is probably best way.
